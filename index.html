            <p>Moniruzzaman Shawon, the broken heart with loosing hopes and aim. Everyday starts with a new day and a
                new
                life. But it is too tough to catch the opportunity behind us or infront of us. Life gives everyone a
                second
                chance. On point, "Second Chance"; it might not be like the first one. Now decision is ours whether we
                will
                take it or not!</p>

                junior designation means you work under the supervision of senior developers in your department, but you
                may be involved in all stages of the project, from brainstorming to final testing.</p>
